# Conductor Workspace

This folder stores structured project context for Codex.

Workflow:
1. Run `conductor:status` (or `conductor_status`) at the start of every session.
2. Define/refresh context in `context/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.
3. Write specs in `specs/` before code changes.
4. Write implementation plans in `plans/`.
5. Implement and verify.
